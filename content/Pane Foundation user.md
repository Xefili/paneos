## Overview
The Pane Foundation user is similar to the Trusted Installer in Windows NT. It has full system rights. The user can not be accessed under normal circumstances and requires multiple criteria to be accessed.

## Access criteria
To access this user, the system must not be in [[Lockdown Mode]] and should be in recovery mode. Sometimes, the user can be accessed via an administrator command prompt in a low memory situation.
