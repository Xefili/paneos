## Overview
The Android subsystem allows you to run android applications (`.apk` or `.xapk`) in a containerized environment. The Subsystem runs the latest available android version (14) and emulates an arm64 machine.
This subsystem may share files with the [[Linux Subsystem]] but not with the [[Windows Subsystem]].
