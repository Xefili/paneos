The Kernel in PaneOS Server is a different from the one used in standard PaneOS. It includes performance optimizations and some cutting edge features.
It is generally a more stable kernel.

The server kernel also uses [[Orchestrator]] as it's main backend, but can also fall back on the legacy handlers, as well as use the [[pnUtils]] utility.
