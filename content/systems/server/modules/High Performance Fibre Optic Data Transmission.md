## Overview
HPFDT is a tool to send and receive large amounts of data over dual or multi link fibre optic cables. It can handle and distribute up to 0.8 Pbit/s[^1]  (Petabits per second) of continuous uncompressed data per Core.

## Maximum Throughput
### Dual Core (no multiplexing)
ca. 0.8 Pbit/s per Core (up & down)

### Dual Core (with multiplexing)
ca. 5,6 Pbit/s per Core using 7 different wave lengths

### Standard 16 Core (8/8)
ca. 44,8 Pbit/s using 7 different wave lengths

### Maxilink Plus (32, 16/16, mul7)
ca. 90 Pbit/s using 7 different wave lengths and 16 cores.

## Data Processing
Because of the slow 60 GB/s speed of PCIe Gen5, multiple slots have to be populated to accommodate the extra speeds required to take full advantage of the Fibre Optic connection (0.8 Pbit/s = 100,000 GB/s).
