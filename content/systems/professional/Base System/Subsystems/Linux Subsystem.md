#subsystems
## Overview
The Linux Subsystem translates linux API calls to PaneOS API calls. The system can run terminal based apps natively and most graphical apps in virtual container. The Subsystem is based on Debian Version 12. 

## Historical Information & Compatability
On [[PaneOS Legacy]], the subsystem used Debian 11 for versions 12 through 20 and version 10 for any prior versions.
Graphical app support was added in PaneOS 1.
