## Overview
PaneOS allows for all icons to be themed with the system's accent colour. The icons are send to a server to generate a simplified grayscale version, which allows PaneOS to add the theme colours. Works together with custom [[Themes]].

## Issues
Complex icons may look blurry or get blank. This can not be fixed and it is up to developers whether to include a simplified grayscale version of their icon with the app package.
