## Overview
The Glass CPU line-up was a major breakthrough in the home and professional PC market. The Glass CPUs used spec-like x86_64. The fastest CPU; the Glass 9 7950XT shipped with 12 cores and 24 threads. 4 out the 12 cores were eco cores. The CPU ran at 1.7GHz and boosted to 4.7GHz.

[^1]:Here, this is L4 cache.
[^2]:CEX, Cache Expanded Memory, is a technology allowing the use of register-like memory as RAM. This can quadruple memory bandwidth but is a very expensive type of memory. Cannot be combined with normal RAM.
[^3]:Octa-channel memory requires a motherboard with eight or more memory slots.
[^4]:Faster speeds require CEX memory
