## Overview
Quixel is the latest generation of CPUs, created by [[Pane Electronics]]. They support the [[x86_64-vX|x86_64-v3]] instruction set and use the quixel architecture. The line-up allows for multiple CPUs to chained together on one or more motherboard through the [[Quixel Bridge]]. This technology opens up the cache (L1-L4) of the individual CPUs.
