## Overview
Quixel is the latest generation of CPUs, created by [[Pane Electronics]]. They support the x86-v3 instruction set and use the quixel architecture. The lineup allows for multiple CPUs to chained together on one or more motherboard through the [[Quixel Bridge]]. This technology opens up the cache (L1-L4) of the individual CPUs.
