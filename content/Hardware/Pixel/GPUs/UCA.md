## Overview
UCA cores, short for **U**nified **C**ompute **A**rchitecture, are general purpose processing cores. The are able to do floating point calculations, matrix, and vector calculations. They are also used for hashing algorithms.

### 1st Generation
Found in [[Pixel GPU#Consumer Cards|Consumer and Professional Cards]].
### 2nd Generation
The second generation of UCA cores are about 3-4x faster and consume 60% less energy than first generation UCA cores. They are found in [[Pixel GPU#Datacenter Cards|Pixel Datacenter Cards]].
