## Overview
The Pixel GPU line-up is split into two sections; consumer and professional cards. They share the same release cycle as [[Quixel CPUs]].

### Professional Cards
Pixel Pro GPUs are equipped with more video memory and may use different cooling methods. Those cards are often rack mounted and used in servers. They therefore have a closed chassis with the front and back open.

### Consumer Cards
Pixel Consumer GPUs are GPUs tailored for consumers and hobbyists. They usually have a pass-through or Axial fan design, but blower version are also available. They come with less video memory but might offer better gaming support and better game optimization.

### Datacenter Cards
Pixel Pro for Datacenter cards are GPUs made for rack usage and are sold directly to businesses. Datacenter GPUs come in three different product lines:
- [[Pixel Pro A]]
- [[Pixel Pro H]]
- [[Pixel Pro HX]]
All of these cards come in PCIe, SXM or [[Rack provided Power|RpP]] form factors.
