## Overview
Scalar is a GTP powered Chat Bot created by the Pane AI Foundation. The model is constantly updated and runs on the cloud, as well as on certain supported computers.

## AI on bare metal
Scalar can be run on [[Quixel CPUs]] using the Scalar Multiplication Engine (SME) and the built-in Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). 
It can also be run on non Quixel CPUs, but performance without a powerful graphics, or neural processing card will suffer.

These models are also optimized to run on [[Pixel GPU#Datacenter Cards|Datacenter Cards]] like the [[Pixel Pro A]] and [[Pixel Pro H]](X as well). This execution method is preferred over CPU, due to the increased performance and decreased energy consumption.

## AI on the cloud
Most users will probably use Scalar on the Cloud. This is possible thanks to the Pane Cloud service which provides the technology and infrastructure for a mass scale AI integration.
