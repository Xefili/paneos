## Overview
A compute node is defined as a single [[PaneOS Server Structure.canvas|PaneOS Server Structure]] instance.

## Types
Compute nodes can be generalized or set to only be used for a single compute operation.
For example, a compute node can be a neural processing node for faster neural expressions or a serverless function executer.
