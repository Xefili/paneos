## Overview
Journal is a feature rich note taking app. It has great stylus and touch support and is primarily used on tablets and tablet-computers.

## Input features
### QuickText
QuickText allows you to transform your handwriting into a normal font for easier readability (ha, this ones for you Matthias!). Select a place on the page and start writing anywhere on your display!

### Math Input
The [[Math Input]] Utility allows you to transform handwritten math equations and expressions into proper styled expressions using the PMath[^1] font. It also allows you to input equations as Unicode or as LaTeX formulas. LaTeX formulas are parsed with  KaTeX. The result looks similar to this:
```latex
$$\sum_{n=1}^{k} k^2 = \cdots$$
```
$$\sum_{n=1}^{k} k^2 = \cdots$$
### Study Mode
Use AI[^2] to create flash cards and custom quizzes. Use study mode to put "tape" over answers and tap again to remove and reveal the answer!
